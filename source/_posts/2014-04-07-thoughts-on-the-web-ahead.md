# The web

As a long time listener to [The web ahead]() and reading [@jensimmons]() (blog post)[http://jensimmons.com/note/2014/04/09/web-ahead-triple-play]


wherein Jen muses with ?? about the influx of new folks on the web and worries about their values. Well I have a foot in both camps here having started as a front-end guy, drifted over to the server and now probably 50/50.


Back in the day, the web standards movement advocated for standards compliant, cross device, appropriately semantic way of styling and presenting content. Of course Javascript existed but its role was as a layer of optional niceness.

And they won. The tenets of web standards are now the accepted way to build websites. The success of the web in general has opened a new battle - that of the application development platform

## A new war needs new recruits

The web is now competing on another front, that of application development platform - a battle that requires more recruits with different skills. A war I might add that it is not clear the web will win.

## What to do

It feels to me like Jen is correct. There is an influx of new people working on the web. There are a whole new set of people who have yet to learn that, for all its technical limitations, web workers hold themselves to a higher bar. That progressive enhancement is more than a nice to have. But also we need to be patient with the new folks. Application development on the web is immature and damn hard right now.

Time out that old blue beanie and suit up for some teaching.
