I have been a professional bit-herd in some capacity since 2001 mostly in the pastures of web and scripting. I once dabbled in hospitality and construction but it was frighteningly like real work so I stopped. Mostly I love making the web work for people.

In my spare time I to take photos and cook. I swear too much, bake bread and drink beer. Occasionally I bake so much bread I fall over.

Content here is ramblings, shared learnings, probably other 'ings.
