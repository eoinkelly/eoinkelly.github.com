At the end of July, I found myself travelling from NZ to Ireland at short notice. So I armed myself with a copy of the Pickaxe book, a notepad and a pen.

I have been a web programmer for quite a while not. I cut my teeth with mod_perl because at the time my job was mostly server side scripting and admin in Perl. Since then, my work has mostly been in PHP mostly due to it's "always there" behaviour. My work in recent years has leaned towards front-end (HTML, CSS, JS) so

I had used ruby tools (I'm a big fan of Sass) but had never played with the language.

So this was the perspective I brought to my first date with Ruby.

## First Impressions


## The People
As I worked my way through the Ruby Rogues podcast, I found myself feeling "at home". Irrespective of the language, the ruby community appears to have a much higher level of "give a shit"'ness than I found in PHP. It's entirely possible that this exists in PHP and I missed it. In particular, the offer from Avdi Grimm to pair program with randoms seems amazing.

The other revelation to me was testing. Certainly, TDD, BDD and friends are not limited to ruby but

The outlook.
The ruby rogues podcast talks so casually about learning other languages - very impressive.

I guess I finally understand now that the language I need to learn next is ... all of them.

# The Language
I didn't approach Ruby as a beginner (or so I thought) but

# My bit on the side

While I don't have any opportuntiey to persue Ruby as part of my day job, I'll still keep in touchw ith it because

* Tools. The ruby community seems to be a rich source of tooling for web developers. Profeciency in ruby will stand to me here
* Software craft. The ruby community seems to have a higher than average level of "give a shit" about what they do.
* The outlook. I guess I finally understand now that the language I need to learn next is ... all of them.
